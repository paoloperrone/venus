\chapter{Youth and apprenticeship}

I loathed my father with every drop of my blood.

Our blood had united us, since I had come to the world.

Our blood had united us, for as long as he lived.

Only now I wonder if he could sense the hate that I was harboring.
Did that make the last years of his life harder? If so, then at least we are even. 
I cannot ask him anymore, he is too far away, both in time, and in space.
The place where he lies buried, just like the place where I live now, is floating through space, and the two points are always at least a hundred eighty million kilometers apart.
If I could consign this man to oblivion, I would. 

In the last years of his life I haven't even thought that much about him, and when I did, my bitterness had slowly turned into contempt.
I hated his endless citations of the old literature, I hated his fanaticism for a vision in which I couldn't really believe,
and I hated his dull, trite warnings, just before my exile started: ``The truth, son, is in the old books, and in the new research''.
